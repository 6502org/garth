Here's that product, a sophisticated aircraft intercom, with about 900 parts
in a box less than 4" x 5" x 2".  At the top right you can see the CPU
board, with an 8Kx8 EPROM on the solder side of the board.  When we
introduced it at a major airshow, one of the competitors was sure it was
vaporware and the real work was being done by a big box under the counter.
Our president picked it up and showed him that's all there was.  He was
speechless and his face turned several colors.

In the early stages of development, I considered several different
microcontrollers for the job.  Many had severe limitations for our
application.  One manufacturer actually told us that we basically were too
small for them to be interested in our business.  We settled on one of the
Motorola 68HC11's.  Unfortunately the version we needed with EEPROM and lots
of EPROM was on allocation and not easy to buy.  As it ended up, we just
went back to a discrete 65c02 computer on its own board.  Our cost for parts
and labor was approximately what the HC11 was going to cost anyway--  it
just took a little more room.  (Again, the EPROM is on the back, making the
board smaller.)  Since then, it seems like Microchip PICs have practically
taken over.  The processor in them is really lowsy compared to the 65c02,
but they have a lot of variations, features, I/O, built-in processor support
like reset circuit and watchdog timer, etc., have good technical support
with lots of ap. notes and free assembler etc., and are inexpensive and
widely available, making them well suited for tiny jobs.
