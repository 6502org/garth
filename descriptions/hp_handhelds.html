Although this does not have to do directly with 6502 projects, I'm including
my HP-41cx hand-held computer, and further down, the HP-71, because of all
the inspiration these have given me for my 6502 projects.  Both have
expandable operating systems, file chains in non-volatile RAM, expansion
ports, the interface loop (HP-IL), and tons of other features that serve as
outstanding models of engineering.  The LCD here says, "INPUT:  -7.2dBV"

This is the top end of the HP-41cx, showing the four ports.  I had a friend
scan the picture and I'm a little disappointed that the scan took away so
much detail in the dark area.  I have the ZENROM module in one port (for
synthetic and assembly-language programming), the Advantage module in
another (with a long list of math functions), and in a third port, the
interface loop as well as the Extended I/O module which I had built into it
so I wouldn't run out of ports.  One port is still empty.  I wish I had
gotten a large RAM for it when they were available.  The 41cx is like a 41cv
with built-in time module, extended functions, some extended memory, text
editor, and some other things not available on the 41cv.

<p>I have the IEEE-488 interface converter for HP-IL, which I used with this
computer to control a rack of equipment in the late 80's at a little company
where I worked.  This controlled the production testing of the first
$2,000,000 of a particular product we made.  Then it was replaced with an
HP-9000-series computer with a 68000 processor.

<p>What attracted me so strongly about these little computers was the extreme
portability and their capabilities in data acquisition and control.  I kept
thinking I would like to make a computer resembling these, using a 65c02.
Why?  Weren't these HPs adequate?  Actually, they are extremely
sophisticated, even in their I/O; but when microsecond control of lots of
individual I/O bits is important, something else is needed.

This is the HP-71--  far more powerful than the HP-41.  It has by far the
best BASIC I've ever seen (occupying about 200KB, mostly in ROM) but a
rather poor implementation of Forth.  This is where I originally learned
Forth.  I've never used the assembler for it, but I do have, and use, a lot
of very efficient BASIC extensions written in assembly by the users' groups.
This computer has four ports in the front, plus the HP-IL port in the back
on the left, and the card reader port at the top right where I instead have
an extra 96KB of RAM.  Card-reader-port RAM modules were available with up
to 160KB, but I got all I could afford at the time.  There have been a few
times it would have been nice to have more.  I do have another 64KB of extra
RAM in one of the front ports.

<p>So what would be the chances of being able to build a portable computer with
the HPs in mind, that had a lot of I/O and was small and thin enough to
throw into the atache case?
